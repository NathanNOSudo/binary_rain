# binary_rain

## About
Just a sheel script that when ran will make your terminal appear to be the matrix. Pipe it with [!lolcat](https://github.com/busyloop/lolcat) for a beautiful binary rain storm.

## Instructions
* Clone the repo
 ```
 git clone https://github.com/NathanNOSudo/binary_rain.git
 ```
* Change to the directory:
 ```
 cd binary_rain
 ```
* Now you need to make it executable:
 ```
 chmod +x matrix_rain.sh
 ```
* It is now executable by running with this command:
 ```
 ./matrix_rain.sh
 ```
### Note
You can add it to your path if youâ€™d like to execute in any directory but doing it this way you can only execute it in the directory containing it.

## [!lolcat](https://github.com/busyloop/lolcat)
Once you have lolcat installed you can pipe it by running:
```
./matrix_rain.sh | lolcat
```
